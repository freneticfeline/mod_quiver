## Added items
- Bow and Quiver
- Iron Arrow
- Torch Arrow
- Teleport Arrow
- Exploding Arrow
- Water Arrow
- Lava Arrow
- Ender Shard

### Bow and Quiver
An empty Bow and Quiver is crafted with a normal bow recipe with the three empty slots filled with Leather.
An empty Bow and Quiver is useless until it is loaded with arrows.  Regular arrows, as well as any type of
arrow provided by this mod, can be "loaded" into the Bow and Quiver on the crafting table 
using a shapeless recipe consisting of
the empty Bow and Quiver, and either 3 or 8 of a single type of arrow.  (That way, the bow can be loaded
either in the crafting table or the player inventory crafting box.)  The Bow and Quiver can be continually
loaded with either 3 or 8 arrows of whatever type is already in the quiver until the maximum capacity of 64
arrows is reached.  If fewer than 8 additional arrows can fit in the quiver, the exact number of missing
arrows can be added.

Once a particular type of arrow has been loaded into a Bow and Quiver, only that type of arrow can be
added to that Bow and Quiver.  However, once all of the arrows have been exhausted and the Bow and Quiver
is empty, any type of arrow can be loaded into it again.

### Iron Arrow
This arrow is constructed the same as a regular Arrow, but with an Iron Ingot in place of the stick.
Iron arrows fly faster and farther than regular arrows and do nearly twice the damage.

### Torch Arrow
This arrow is constructed with a shapeless recipe from a normal Arrow and a normal torch.  When fired,
a torch will be mounted at the point of impact, if possible.

### Teleport Arrow
This arrow is constructed with a shapeless recipe from a normal Arrow and an Ender Shard (which is an
item added by this mod). When fired, the player will be teleported to the point of impact.

### Exploding Arrow
This arrow is constructed with a shapeless recipe from a normal Arrow and a Gunpowder.  When fired,
it will cause an explosion at the point of impact.  The strength of the explosion depends on the
length of time that the bow is held before release.  Hold for 30 seconds for a massively devastating
explosion.

### Water Arrow
This arrow is constructed with a shapeless recipe from 3 normal Arrows and a Bucket of Water, and
results in 3 Water Arrows.  When fired, it will create a block of Water at the point of impact, as
though it had been placed by a Bucket of Water.

### Lava Arrow
This arrow is constructed with a shapeless recipe from a normal Arrow and a Bucket of Lava.  When
fired, it will create a block of Lava at the point of impact, as though it had been placed by a
Bucket of Lava.  (No, I will not make one Bucket of Lava create more than one Lava Arrow, as that
would make Lava, and in turn Obsidian, into a renewable resource.)

### Ender Shard
The ender shard is used to create Teleport Arrows.  A shapeless recipe will convert one Ender Pearl into
4 Ender Shards and vice versa.


## Credits
The idea of a Bow and Quiver was inspired by a number of existing "More Weapons" type mods, as well
as the Quiver texture that exists but is unused in vanilla Minecraft.
